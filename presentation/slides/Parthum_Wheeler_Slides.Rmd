<h1>Motivation</h1>

<h2>What is the goal?</h2>

  - The ability to quantify and classify the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
  
    - Think of this as capacity building. In order to ask interesting questions, we need to have the infrastructure in place to objectively read, process, and quantify federal documents.

<h2>What do we mean by <span style="color:#01c748">quantify</span> and <span style="color:#004fb9">classify</span>?</h2>

count: false

  - There are many metrics, each are useful in their own way
    - Scoring within (<span style="color:#01c748">\# words</span>, <span style="color:#01c748">rarity</span>, etc.)
    - Scoring across (<span style="color:#004fb9">networks</span>, <span style="color:#004fb9">dependencies</span>, etc.)
  
  - Note: In the CFR, these measures have variation within parts, across parts, and across time

???

Upstream processing that will be used as inputs to other applications
Methods: classification using Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

1. Reduce the dimensionality of the text

<h1>Products</h1>

<br>
<h2>1. Code and documentation</h2>
  - Likely all in R, although there might be Python integration (all open source)
  - Public and freely available on GitHub
  

<h2>2. NCEE Working Paper</h2>
  - Summarize our approach to quantifying the CFR
  - An application to several outcomes of interest

---

<h1>Applications</h1>

<h2>Regulatory outcomes</h2>

  - NPDES, SDWA, RCRA, CERCLA (Superfund), etc.
  - Permitting: violations/non-compliance, proportion of applications approved, complaints
  - Litigation: length, contract completeness
  - EPA regulations that fall under other agencies (USGS, USDA, etc.)
  - Regulation across media (are water regs consistent with air, etc.)<sup>1</sup>

<h2>Environmental outcomes</h2>

  - Surface water and air quality (WQI/AQI)
  - Drinking water quality, test outcomes, etc.
  - Specific toxics as endpoints (how can we show the different ways that lead is regulated)<sup>1</sup>

.font60[[1] Examples of outcomes that are internal to the CFR]

<h1>Econometrics</h1>

<h3>What does a regression look like?</h3>

$$y_{{\small \bf{V}}t}=\bf{X}\beta + \Phi(\bf{C}_{{\small \widehat{\hskip-0.5pt \bf{V}}}t})\delta + \varepsilon_{{\small \bf{V}}t}$$
  - $\bf{C}$ is upstream NLP processing of $\mathcal{D}$ (<span style="color:#01c748">quantify</span>)
  - $\widehat{\hskip-0.5pt \bf{V}}$ is predicted class using ML (<span style="color:#004fb9">classify</span>)
  
  - $\Phi(\bf{C}_{{\small \widehat{\hskip-0.5pt \bf{V}}}t})$ can consist of many metrics/features:
    - sum of word/phrase count (simple "token" score)
    - sum of TF-IDF scores in part/subpart
    - relational/network features of other parts $\in\mathcal{D}$
    - relational/network features of other documents $\notin\mathcal{D}$
  
---

<h1>Other Applications and Extensions</h1>

<h2>Other applications and extensions</h2>
  - Spatial distribution of Title 40 (map network/complexity to geographical units, demographics, industries)
  - Process ICRs 
  - Complexity of EPA Guidelines
  - Leadership influence on network/complexity (i.e. $\bf{C}_{{\small \widehat{\hskip-0.5pt \bf{V}}}t}$ becomes dependent variable)
  - Apply text methods to permits, consumer confidence reports, FOIA requests, and on and on
